I managed to cross-compile git for webos/arm devices.
I'll include the modifications to the git source that made this possible.
I'll also provide a precompile binary in another branch for convenience.

The process was rather simple.
This process was performed on Macos

1. install Palm PDK for MacOS
1. $ export PATH="/opt/PalmPDK/arm-gcc/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/bin/:$PATH"
2. $ ./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --build=x86-apple-darwin
	 verify this says it detected cross-compilation, and completes with no issues.
	 I suspect there were 2 issues I had to fix in this file.
	 Where the configuration fails because 2 tests depend on the compiled being able to create and runnable executables on the local system.
	 these are easily fixed by removing those parts fo the configure script.
	 and just setting whatever variable they were going set if they passed.
	 the post-altered configure script is checked in. incase you need to reduplicate this process.
3. modify the generated config.mak.autogen
	 adding NO_NSEC=Yes to the bottom of the file. to overcome to time structure issues.
	 possibly adding -I and -L to include /opt/PalmPDK/include and /opt/PalmPDK/device/lib respectively.
4. modify the Makefile to include the config.mak.autogen
	 I may be mistaken on this one. I thinkt he Makefile is already including this file.
5. make
	 the make should run flawlessly, and leave you with a 'git' execution for ARM
	 you can always verify this with a quick 
	 $ file git

if the git executable is still a MacOS darwin executable. Then it was using the mac gcc instead of the PalmPDK gcc.
if you get errors about trying to link to libz.a in /opt/local,
then you need to ensure the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS are getting through (i.e. are set in the config.mak.autogen or other files.

To save time. See the git branch 'precompiled_binary' for a copy of the actual final binary that was generated.
